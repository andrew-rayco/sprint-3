#Github Website Redesign

##What is you site's primary purpose?
Ultimately, to appeal to potential employers. To demonstrate my technical
capacity and otherwise advertise myself for employment.

##Who is your target audience?
Employers, other members of the professional web development community

##How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
I'd like visitors to be delighted by a pleasant visual design. Minimal and
simple. Easy to find information, and pleasant to read blog entries.

##How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
Lots of space. Big, clear introduction. Pleasant palette. Light, informative
and, straight to the point content.
